## Welcome to my profile

:computer: I started as a self-taught developer about 4 years ago and earned badges in organizations like Hackerrack, Codeacademy, and FreeCodeCamp. A year ago, I joined Microverse, an online training program for **<i>Full-stack developers</i>** where I spend 8 hours a day remotely with other developers working on multiple projects built with HTML/CSS, JS, React and Redux, and Ruby on Rails . This has helped me build my network through active collaboration with other remote developers and taught me proactive communication and how to conduct meetings in a professional environment.

:mortar_board: Currently, I'm working part-time as a Code Reviewer at ![Microverse](https://img.shields.io/badge/Microverse-blueviolet), an online program for remote software developers, where I perform code reviews to help students identify and fix bugs to improve app perfomance.

&nbsp;

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m interested in AI, blockchain, innovation, and contributing to open source. I hope to invent something that will revolutionize the world on the level of Elon Mask's Tesla and SpaceX.
- ðŸŒ± I love a challenge and growth. I'm an INTJ; which means that I'm very logically minded, intuitive, analytical, and with excellent problem-solving skills. I am very principled when it comes to morality and ethics.
- ðŸ‘¯ Through Microverse, I've learned to love collaboration; which we practiced through remote pair programming. I found working in teams and solving challenges in groups to be very productive and insightful.

## About myself

  Apart from my passion for web development:
  - I love movies :movie_camera:. Specifically the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). To take my mind off things I usually watch YouTube movie reviews, reactions, comics talk, upcoming movies and I'ld like to think I'm a movie critic myself.:smirk:
  - I spend some of my time building worlds in my mind, generating ideas and occasionally debating with myself about current issues :laughing:... what? My mind works like a giant computer I can't help it :see_no_evil:
  - My friends say that I'm very intellectual, a perfectionist and an over-achiever.
  - I'ld love to travel and explore the world in the near future. Especially attending tech events and innovative exhibitions all around the world.
  - I play tennis :tennis:, and I love extreme sports like snowboarding :snowboarder:, skiing :ski:, surfing :surfer:, cycling :bicyclist:, sky diving, bungee jumping, and hiking. I'm also a big fan of the Olympics, especially athletics.
